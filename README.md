# StudyBuddy
StudyBuddy is a web-based study assistant that helps college students convert raw lecture notes into structured, personalized study plans. The system combines automatic summarization, diagnostic and customizable practice tests, and calendar-based scheduling using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and carefully engineered large language model (LLM) prompts.
We evaluate StudyBuddy through two user studies: one focused on interface usability, and another comparing the effectiveness of basic versus engineered prompts for generating practice tests. Participants rated the engineered prompts as significantly more relevant, challenging, and helpful.
